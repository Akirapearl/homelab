# My homelab repo
Ideally you can use these scripts too.

## General idea/concept
Upload all working and operative scripts i will be using on my local server, so anyone can take references, this is mostly a portfolio oriented repo, as well as a learning experience for myself. 

## Conceptual diagram
![Custom Diagram for a local server Ansible deployment, includes images for reference of the technologies in use for this setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Akirapearl/homelab/main/images/server.png)

## Configuration stages - Before anything else
- Install Ansible locally, wipe server with fresh OS installation.
- Define working directory and Ansible's inventory.
- Configure SSH keys.
- Check connectivity via ansible all -m ping.

Progress: TBD.
