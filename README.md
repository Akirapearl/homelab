# Welcome to my Homelab repo

## What's this repo about?

At the time of writing I have a HP EliteDesk 800 G2 with enough capabilities to host proxmox and some local workflows, so I'm taking the chance to rebuild
this repo onto a newer, better one.

### Roadmap - What do I want to achieve for this project?

 * Refresh my knowledge with technologies such as [Ansible](https://github.com/Akirapearl/Ansible).
 * Learn new things (Proxmox, Terraform, Selfhosting)
 * Enjoy, and end up with a daily companion for my learning and/or daily tasks, entirely made up by myself.

### Roadmap - What's done so far?

    - [x] Installed Proxmox within the server and managed ssh keys.
    - [x] Install Ansible locally (laptop), test connectivity against Proxmox server (ssh/Ansible).
    - [ ] Harden remote access.
    - [ ] Create a VM - Manually vs Automated.
    - [ ] Install NextCloud.
    - [ ] Get a monitoring solution.
    - [ ] Create a container - Manually vs Automated.
    - [ ] More to come...
