# Welcome to my Homelab repo

## What's this repo about?

At the time of writing I have a  HP EliteDesk 800 G2 with enough capabilities to host proxmox and some local workflows, so I'm taking the chance to rebuild
this repo onto a newer, better one.

### Roadmap - What do I want to achieve for this project?

 * Refresh my knowledge with technologies such as [Ansible](https://github.com/Akirapearl/Ansible) and push for more insight on those.
 * Learn new things (Proxmox, Tech2, Tech3)
 * Enjoy, and end up with a daily companion for my learning and/or daily tasks, entirely made up by myself.

### Roadmap - What's done so far?

    - [x] Installed Proxmox within the server and managed ssh keys.
    - [ ] Install Ansible locally, test connectivity, harden remote access (more).
    - [ ] Create a VM - Manually vs Automated.
    - [ ] Create a container - Manually vs Automated.
    - [ ] More to come...
